# FUTURE_DS_03
# 🚧 Road Accident Analysis Dashboard

An end-to-end data-driven project aimed at analyzing and visualizing road accident data to uncover insights for public safety improvements. This project leverages **Python** for data processing and predictive modeling, and **Power BI** for interactive dashboarding and geographic mapping.

---

## 📌 Objective

To analyze real-world accident data to:
- Identify **high-risk locations** (hotspots)
- Understand patterns in **accident severity**
- Explore correlations with **weather, lighting, and road surface**.
- Predict accident severity using machine learning
- Deliver actionable insights through interactive **Power BI visuals**

---

## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies

- **Python** (Pandas, Folium)
- **Power BI** (DAX, Power Query, Azure Maps)
- **Excel** (initial data storage)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (model training and EDA)
- **Folium** (for geospatial visualization)

---

## 📊 Key Features

### 🔥 Hotspot Mapping
- Plotted accident clusters using **latitude and longitude**
- Heatmaps generated with **Folium** 
- Severity-based color-coded maps to indicate danger zones

### 📈 Time & Severity Analysis
- Extracted time-based trends to highlight peak accident hours
- Visualized severity distribution over time, weather, vehicle types, and road types
